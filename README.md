# CP-DSA
This is a repository which holds solutions of various popular programming problems from well known websites like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and  [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/). The set of problems are firmly divided based on the websites from where they are taken. Which are further sub-divided into smaller categories on the basis of DSA classes where they all fall into. Moreover, some typical algorithms which are moderately large in size and heavily used in various problems are also made available as a collection in an seperate folder called [Algorithms](https://github.com/SohamChattopadhyayEE/CP-DSA/blob/main/Algorithms). Following hyperlinks redirect to those sub-classes of problems and those algorithms. All of these problems are solved in either `Java` or `Python3` programming language.
